# Grammar Scoring Engine

## Project Overview
The Grammar Scoring Engine is a web application that allows users to upload voice samples for analysis of their grammar accuracy. The application processes audio files, transcribes them into text, and evaluates the quality of the grammar using advanced language processing tools. The results include a grammar score, transcription, and feedback to help users improve their language skills.

## Installation

To get started with the Grammar Scoring Engine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- SpeechRecognition
- Pydub
- LanguageTool Python
- A local or cloud SQLite database for storing analysis results

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grammar-scoring-engine.git
   cd grammar-scoring-engine
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy SpeechRecognition pydub language_tool_python
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Click on the "Choose Audio File" button to upload either a `.wav` or `.mp3` audio file.
3. Press the "Analyze Grammar" button to start the analysis.
4. The application will show the grammar score, transcription of the audio, and some feedback based on the analysis.

## Features

- Upload and process audio files in `.wav` or `.mp3` format.
- Transcription of the audio input for easy review.
- Grammar scoring based on error count related to the total word count.
- Feedback to indicate the quality of grammar used in the audio sample.
- Storage of analysis results in a SQLite database for future reference.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies, which can be found in `requirements.txt` or installed directly using `pip`:

- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- SpeechRecognition
- Pydub
- LanguageTool Python

### Additional Requirements
- `ffmpeg` or `libav` must be installed on your system to handle audio file conversions. Refer to their documentation for installation instructions.
